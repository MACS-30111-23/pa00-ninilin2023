## Summary of Github
Since this is my first time using GitHub, I would like to share some thoughts as a first-time learner. I enjoy its version control system, where I can create a new branch to make changes and delete the original branch after the requests are reviewed. I often encounter version control issues on other platforms, such as R, but GitHub has made this process easier for me. I also appreciate the tutorial information that GitHub provides, as the tutorials are quite hands-on.
